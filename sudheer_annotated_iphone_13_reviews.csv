4,"Love it! The camera quality stands out for me it’s too good, the screen is vibrant and I get one day battery backup upon minimal use. iPhone definitely has a clean and sophisticated user experience (except the notification tabs).",positive
5,"The phone is awesome. The smoothness, the camera quality, display and the voice clarity are great. There is way better safety as every app asks to get tracked or not, to send you notifications or you can deny it. The phone in itself is so smooth and it’s so easy to edit videos or reels as no lagging is there.While the experience of switching from android to iOS was great, but there are so many things which are way more complicated in iOS.I can’t use true-caller and have to manually check the number, no headphone jack and airpods are kinda not useful for someone who talks for long hours on calls. (Planning to get the lightning cable wired apple earphones).Also, the fact that it does not have fingerprint is kinda shocking as phones starting from 10k also have that feature now, guess apple should really look in to it.Overall, I feel the pros outweigh the cons.Lastly, the BEST feature is the camera. The crystal clear quality of the camera was one of the reasons why I wanted to get the phone. My father has a Z fold, and personally I like the camera of the iPhone 13 way way better. Could be a personal preference, but I am satisfied.",positive
6,"I just love this model! Yes please would argue that it’s an old model but hear me out. The battery backup is substantially better than 14/15. The camera quality stands at power, the charging even tho not C type charges pretty quickly, the base and the speakers it’s pretty good. And even though the refresh rate is not that great, but it’s the exact same in 14/15.Not just that but there have been certain major issues with both those models that have put them on a really low selling models for Apple.",positive

This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.",positive
8,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.",positive
